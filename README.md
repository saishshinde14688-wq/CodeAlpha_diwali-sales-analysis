# 🛍️ Diwali Sales Data Analysis

An in-depth Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) project focused on analyzing the sales data from the Diwali festival season to uncover key customer trends, purchase patterns, and product performance.

## 🎯 Project Goal

The primary objective of this analysis is to:
1.  **Identify the top-performing customer segments** based on demographics (Gender, Age Group, Marital Status) and professional background (Occupation).
2.  **Determine the most popular product categories** purchased during the Diwali festival.
3.  **Provide data-driven insights** that can help businesses optimize inventory, target marketing campaigns, and maximize sales revenue in future festive seasons.

## 🔑 Key Findings 

Based on the analysis of over 11,000 sales records, the most lucrative customer segment is:

> **Married women** in the **26-35 years** age group, residing in **Uttar Pradesh, Maharashtra, and Karnataka**, and working in the **IT, Healthcare, and Aviation** sectors. They are **more likely to buy products** from the **Food, Clothing, and Electronics** categories.

## 📊 Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) Steps

The analysis was performed by following a structured EDA approach:

| Feature Analyzed | Key Visualization Used |
| :--- | :--- |
| **Data Cleaning** | Handled missing values (`NaN` in 'Amount') and dropped irrelevant columns (`Status`, `unnamed1`). |
| **Demographics** | Analyzed Gender and Age Groups to determine purchase power distribution. |
| **Regional Sales** | Identified Top 10 States contributing to total sales revenue. |
| **Occupation & Marital Status** | Visualized the sales contribution based on the customer's job and marital status. |
| **Product Performance** | Determined the Top 10 selling product categories by volume and amount. |

## 🛠️ Technologies & Libraries Used

The project is built using Python and the following key libraries:

* **Python 3.x**
* **`pandas`:** For data manipulation and cleaning.
* **`numpy`:** For numerical operations.
* **`matplotlib`:** For basic data plotting.
